# Hatch Rest – Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration for controlling the **Hatch Rest** (1st-generation) nightlight and sound machine over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Fully asynchronous and locally controlled — no cloud required. Built on a rewritten BLE API derived from the original work by **kjoconnor** in the `pyhatchbabyrest` project.

## ✨ Features

* **Local BLE control** — no cloud, no account required
* **Real-time updates** — state changes are picked up instantly via BLE advertisements and GATT notifications; no polling required for basic state
* **Efficient connections** — commands are batched into a single BLE session; the connection is held open for 10 seconds of idle time before disconnecting, preventing radio thrash during rapid changes
* **Full favorites support** — reads all 6 favorite slots on connect, enables/disables slots without overwriting their content, and exposes only enabled favorites in the selector
* **Schedule support** — reads all 10 schedule slots and exposes enable/disable toggles for each
* **Timer control** — set and monitor a sleep timer; the remaining time is shown as a live-countdown sensor
* **Configurable refresh interval** — adjust how often the integration re-fetches favorites and schedules via the options flow (default: 10 minutes)
